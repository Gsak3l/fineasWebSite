        <h3>Mythology</h3>
        According to Greek mythology, Phineus was blinded by Zeus, who sent him the Harpies, in order for them to take his
        food
        away and keep him always hungry. His liberators, were the Argonauts, to whom Phineus revealed how to get to their
        destination and how to pass the Symplegades safely, the huge rocks, which constantly clashed together, so that no
        ship
        could go through.
